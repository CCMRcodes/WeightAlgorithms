	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most US adults are overweight or obese. Understanding differences in obesity prevalence across subpopulations could facilitate the development and dissemination of weight management services.
OBJECTIVES: To inform Veterans Health Administration (VHA) weight management initiatives, we describe obesity prevalence among subpopulations of VHA patients. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive analyses of fiscal year 2014 (FY2014) national VHA administrative and clinical data, stratified by gender. Differences ≥5\% higher than the population mean were considered clinically significant. PARTICIPANTS: Veteran VHA primary care patients with a valid weight within ±365 days of their first FY2014 primary care visit, and a valid height (98\% of primary care patients). MAIN MEASURES: We used VHA vital signs data to ascertain height and weight and calculate body mass index, and VHA outpatient, inpatient, and fee basis data to identify sociodemographic- and comorbidity-based subpopulations. KEY RESULTS: Among nearly five million primary care patients (347,112 women, 4,567,096 men), obesity prevalence was 41\% (women 44\%, men 41\%), and overweight prevalence was 37\% (women 31\%, men 38\%). Across the VHA’s 140 facilities, obesity prevalence ranged from 28\% to 49\%. Among gender-stratified subpopulations, obesity prevalence was high among veterans under age 65 (age 18-44: women 40\%, men 46\%; age 45-64: women 49\%, men 48\%). Obesity prevalence varied across racial/ethnic and comorbidity subpopulations, with high obesity prevalence among black women (51\%), women with schizophrenia (56\%), and women and men with diabetes (68\%, 56\%).
CONCLUSIONS: Overweight and obesity are common among veterans served by the VHA. VHA’s weight management initiatives have the potential to avert long-term},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: For more than a decade, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has offered MOVE!, a comprehensive lifestyle intervention for weight management. However, there is limited knowledge to inform resource allocation decisions at the health system level—for example, the choice between reaching new veterans with weight management treatment, re-engaging veterans who have stopped attending, and/or increasing contact with current MOVE! participants.
OBJECTIVE: To inform VHA policy and planning, this VHA-wide study examines the relationship between MOVE! participation and weight outcomes. DESIGN: A longitudinal observational study of veterans across VHA who participated in MOVE!. PARTICIPANTS: Veterans who initiated their most recent episode of MOVE! care between 2004 and 2014. MAIN MEASURES: Weight measurements were abstracted from VHA electronic health records. The primary outcome was the proportion of veterans with clinically relevant weight loss. The predictor of interest was number of MOVE! contacts during the 12 months following MOVE! initiation. KEY RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 237,577 veterans (87.4\% male; mean age 54.4 years), who had 5.3 contacts on average in the 12 months following initiation. Veterans with 2–5 contacts had the same odds of achieving clinically relevant weight loss as veterans with only one contact (adjusted OR: 1.00, 95\% CI: 0.98–1.03). Veterans with 6–9, 10–13, 14–17, and 18 or more contacts had significantly higher odds of clinically relevant weight loss (adjusted OR: 1.17, 95\% CI: 1.13–1.20; adjusted OR: 1.53, 95\% CI: 1.47–1.59; adjusted OR: 1.84, 95\% CI: 1.74–1.94; adjusted OR: 2.21, 95\% CI: 2.12–2.31, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Veterans with ≥6 MOVE! contacts in the year following treatment initiation were significantly more likely to achieve clinically relevant weight loss than those with one contact, with greater participation further increasing the odds of clinically relevant weight loss. While further characterization of weight loss predictors is needed, the VHA should provide policy guidance that supports increasing participation among veterans who have initiated MOVE!.},

	abstract = {Methods: This observational study evaluated weight loss by SDB status in overweight/obese veterans enrolled in MOVE! from May 2008–February 2012 who had at least two MOVE! visits, baseline weight, and at least one follow-up weight (n = 84,770). SDB was defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Primary outcome was weight change (lb) from MOVE! enrollment to 6- and 12-mo assessments. Weight change over time was modeled with repeated-measures analyses.
Results: SDB was diagnosed in one-third of the cohort (n = 28,269). At baseline, veterans with SDB weighed 29 [48] lb more than those without SDB (P {\textless} 0.001). On average, veterans attended eight MOVE! visits. Weight loss patterns over time were statistically different between veterans with and without SDB (P {\textless} 0.001); veterans with SDB lost less weight (−2.5 [0.1] lb) compared to those without SDB (−3.3 [0.1] lb; P = 0.001) at 6 months. At 12 mo, veterans with SDB continued to lose weight whereas veterans without SDB started to re-gain weight.
Conclusions: Veterans with sleep disordered breathing (SDB) had significantly less weight loss over time than veterans without SDB. SDB should be considered in the development and implementation of weight loss programs due to its high prevalence and negative effect on health.},

	abstract = {Background: Obesity is a substantial problem in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). VHA developed and disseminated the MOVE! Weight Management Program for Veterans to its medical facilities but implementation of the program has been variable.
Purpose: The objective was to explore variation in MOVE! program implementation to identify facility structure, policies, and processes associated with larger patient weight-loss outcomes.
Methods: Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) was used to identify facility conditions or combinations of conditions associated with larger 6-month patient weight-loss outcomes. QCA is a method that allows for systematic cross-case comparison to better understand causal complexity. Eleven sites with larger outcomes and 11 sites with smaller outcomes were identifıed and data were collected with site interviews, facility-completed program summary forms, and medical record abstraction in 2009 and 2010. Conditions were selected based on theory and experience implementing MOVE! and were calibrated using QCA methods. Confıguration patterns were examined to identify necessary conditions (i.e., always present when outcome present, but alone do not guarantee outcome) and suffıcient conditions (i.e., presence guarantees outcome) at sites with larger and smaller outcomes. A thematic analysis of site interview data supplemented QCA fındings.
Results: No two sites shared the same condition pattern. Necessary conditions included the use of a standard curriculum and group care-delivery format, and they were present at all sites with larger outcomes but at only six sites with smaller outcomes. At the 17 sites with both necessary conditions, four combinations of conditions were identifıed that accounted for all sites with larger outcomes. These included high program complexity combined with high staff involvement; group care-delivery format combined with low accountability to facility leadership; an active physician champion combined with low accountability to facility leadership; and the use of quality-improvement strategies combined with not using a waiting list.
Conclusions: The use of a standard curriculum delivered with a group care-delivery format is an essential feature of successful VHA facility MOVE! Weight Management Programs, but alone does not guarantee success. Program development and policy will be used to ensure dissemination of the best practices identifıed in this evaluation.},

Primary outcome determined if topiramate users experienced signiﬁcant changes in weight and body mass index. Secondary outcome analyzed predictive factors associated with 5\% weight loss using logistic regression models. Patients were followed up 1 year post index date. Results: A total of 767 patients were included in the ﬁnal analysis. Patients lost an average of 5.6 lbs (216.1 lbs preweight vs. 210.5 lbs postweight) at an average follow-up of 7.8 months.

Methods: We used chart-reviewed, clinical and administrative VHA data from ﬁscal years 2010–2012 to estimate obesity screening and participation in the VHA’s weight management program (MOVE!) across groups. Six- and 12-month weight changes in MOVE! participants were estimated using linear mixed models adjusted for confounders.
Results: Compared to individuals without SMI/DD, individuals with SMI or DD were less frequently screened for obesity (94\%–94.7\% vs. 95.7\%) but had greater participation in MOVE! (10.1\%–10.4\% vs. 7.4\%). MOVE! participants with SMI or DD lost approximately 1 lb less at 6 months. At 12 months, average weight loss for individuals with SMI or neither SMI/DD was comparable (−3.5 and −3.3 lb, respectively), but individuals with DD lost less weight (mean=−2.7 lb).
Conclusions: Disparities in obesity screening and treatment outcomes across mental health diagnosis groups were modest. However, participation in MOVE! was low for every group, which limits population impact. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Methods—Our study sample included 16,656 veterans post-deployment and entering the Veteran Healthcare Administration (VHA) healthcare system. We used national VHA administrative sociodemo-graphic data, tracked veteran BMI for 6 years, and used trajectory modeling to identify BMI trajectories and sociodemographic characteristics associated with trajectory membership.
Results—Five trajectory groups determined in the full sample were primarily differentiated by their post-deployment initial BMI: “healthy” (14.1\%), “overweight” (36.3\%), “borderline obese” (27.9\%), “obese” (15.7\%), and “severely obese” (6.0). Being female, younger, and white were associated with lower initial BMI trajectory group membership (p’s{\textless}.05). Greater observed BMI increase was associated with higher initial BMI across groups (0.6, 0.8, 1.5, 1.9, 2.7). Gender specific trajectory models found that male Veterans with higher education and white female Veterans were associated with the lowest initial BMI group (p’s{\textless}.05).
Conclusions—Higher post-deployment BMI was associated with greater BMI gain over time for both male and female veterans. Older age is associated with higher BMI regardless of gender. Education level and racial status are differentially related to BMI trajectory by gender.},

	abstract = {Objective—Low body mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for poor longterm outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The purpose of this study was to identify factors associated with longterm changes in BMI.
Methods—Subjects with RA from the Veterans Affairs (VA) Rheumatoid Arthritis (VARA) Registry (n = 1474) were studied. Information on inflammatory markers, presence of erosions, and smoking status were extracted from the VARA database. BMI was extracted from VA electronic medical records within 14 days of each visit date. VA pharmacy records were queried to identify prescriptions for specific RA therapies within 1 month of the visit date. We used robust generalized estimating equations marginal regression models to calculate independent associations between clinical variables and BMI over time. Similar models determined predictors of change in weight and risk of weight loss over the subsequent study observation period.
Results—Increasing age, active smoking, and the presence of erosions at baseline were associated with lower BMI. Weight decreased over time among older adults. Factors associated with greater reductions in BMI over time and a greater risk of weight loss were higher inflammatory markers, smoking, older age, higher BMI, and less subsequent improvement in inflammation. Methotrexate use was associated with a lower risk of weight loss. The use of prednisone or anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies was not associated with change in BMI or the risk of weight loss independent of other factors.
Conclusion—Greater age, greater inflammatory activity, and active smoking are associated with greater weight loss in RA over time.},

	abstract = {Background: Few evaluations of the Veterans Health Administration Motivating Overweight/Obese Veterans Everywhere (MOVE!) weight management program have assessed 6-month weight change or factors associated with weight change by gender. Materials and Methods: Analysis of administrative data from a national sample of veterans in the VA MOVE! program.
Results: A total of 62,882 participants were included, 14.6\% were women. Compared with men, women were younger (49.6 years [standard deviation, SD, 10.8] vs. 59.3 years [SD, 9.8], p {\textless} 0.0001), less likely to be married (34.1\% vs. 56.0\%, p {\textless} 0.0001), and had higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (26.0\% vs. 22.4\%, p {\textless} 0.0001) and depression (49.3\% vs. 32.9\%, p {\textless} 0.001). The mean number of MOVE! visits attended by women was lower than men (5.6 [SD, 5.3] vs. 6.0 [SD, 5.9], p {\textless} 0.0001). Women, compared with men, reported lower rates of being able to rely on family or friends (35.7\% vs. 40.8\%, p {\textless} 0.0001). Observed mean percent change in weight for women was -1.5\% (SD, 5.2) and for men was -1.9\% (SD, 4.8, p {\textless} 0.0001). The odds of ‡5\% weight loss were no different for women (body–mass index [BMI] {\textgreater}25 kg/m2) compared with men (BMI {\textgreater}25 kg/m2; odds ratio, 1.05 [95\% conﬁdence interval, 0.99–1.11; p = 0.13]).
Conclusions: Women veterans lost less weight overall compared with men. There was no difference in the odds of achieving clinically signiﬁcant weight loss by gender. The majority of women and men enrolled lost {\textless}5\% weight despite being enrolled in a lifestyle intervention. Future studies should focus on identifying programand participant-level barriers to weight loss.},

Design and Sample: Using longitudinal clinical data from electronic health records of 216 MOVE!® program participants, weight reduction was examined in this secondary data analysis. Measures: Based on the 2013 guidelines for overweight and obesity management, weights were evaluated at baseline and 6 months following enrollment in the program, and high-intensity MOVE!® was determined by attending 14 or more sessions within the first 6 months following enrollment. Results: High-intensity MOVE!® participants were five times as likely to achieve at least the 5\% weight reduction goal at 6 months compared to those participants with low intensity, while controlling for age, gender, and race (OR = 4.74; CI: 1.3, 17.2; p {\textless} .02). Conclusion: This research supports the 2013 recommendations for high-intensity lifestyle intervention as participants who completed 14 or more sessions were almost five times more likely to achieve a 5\% weight reduction.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE To compare the effectiveness of weight-management medications used to assist with weight loss in real-world clinical practice in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). DESIGN Retrospective, multicenter, observational cohort study. DATA SOURCE National VA Corporate Data Warehouse. PATIENTS A total of 66,035 VA patients aged 18 years or older with a body mass index of 25 kg/m2 or greater who had an initial fill for a study medication (orlistat [6153 patients], phentermine [304 patients], lorcaserin [298 patients], or phentermine-topiramate extended release [233 patients]) or participation in the VA’s MOVE! weight-management program with at least three total visits in a clinic coded as a MOVE clinic in the subsequent 24 weeks (59,047 patients) between January 1, 2012, and July 1, 2016. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The primary outcome was the percentage change in weight from baseline to at least 20 weeks or later (i.e., closest weight to 6 months). Secondary outcomes were difference in the percentage of weight loss at 12 and 36 weeks; changes in blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, high-density and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels; and percentage of patients who achieved at least a 5\% and 10\% weight loss at 6 months from baseline in each group after at least 20 weeks. For the primary outcome, the percentage decrease in weight from baseline after at least 20 weeks in the lorcaserin, phentermine-topiramate, phentermine, orlistat, and MOVE! groups were 3.6\%, 4.1\%, 3.6\%, 2.1\%, and 1.6\%, respectively (phentermine-topiramate group vs. MOVE! group, p{\textless}0.05). Achievement of at least a 5\% weight loss after at least 20 weeks differed significantly among groups, ranging from 26.2\% for the MOVE! Program only group to 40.3\% for patients in the phentermine-topiramate group. CONCLUSION In the VA population, the effectiveness of four available weight-management medications was similar. Patients receiving phentermine-topiramate had a greater proportion of weight loss after at least 20 weeks compared with those solely enrolled in the VA’s MOVE! weight-management program.},

	abstract = {Purpose Systematic reviews have reported that sulfonylureas and metformin were as effective in reducing hemoglobin A1c (A1C) as other oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) in clinical trial populations. Data on comparative effectiveness of OADs in other populations is limited. The objective was to compare the effectiveness of incident OAD regimens in reducing A1C and to compare the effect of OADs on body mass index (BMI).
Methods Retrospective cohort study using data from the Veterans Affairs Mid-South network (2001–2007). Of 18 205 veterans who ﬁlled 19 511 incident OAD prescriptions, 2096 had complete covariates, persisted on their incident treatment for 12 months, and had baseline and 12-month A1C values. For the BMI analysis, 2484 patients had complete information. Incident OAD regimens included metformin and sulfonylureas. Primary outcomes were 12-month A1C and BMI, which were compared controlling for demographic characteristics, baseline A1C and BMI, psychiatric diagnoses, and healthcare utilization.
Results Median [interquartile range (IQR)] A1C decreased from 7.1\% [6.5, 7.8] at baseline to 6.5\% [6.0, 7.0] at 12 months. Twelve monthA1C in sulfonylurea users was similar to metformin users. The median [IQR] BMI decreased from 31.1 [27.8, 34.9] to 30.7 [27.5, 34.5] kg/m2. Sulfonylureas were associated with a signiﬁcantly higher 12-month BMI than metformin (12-month adjusted mean difference: 1.05 kg/m2, 95\%CI: 0.90–1.20, p {\textless} 0.0001).
Conclusions These analyses support the use of metformin as ﬁrst choice of OAD because of similar glycemic control but improved BMI when compared to sulfonylureas. Copyright \# 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Eligibility criteria for MOVE! were being younger than 70 years and having a body mass index (BMI, in kg/m2) of at least 30.0, or 25.0 to 29.9 with an obesity-related condition. To evaluate reach, we estimated the percentage of eligible veterans who participated in the program and their representativeness.

Results Less than 5\% of eligible veterans participated, of whom half had only a single encounter. Likelihood of participation was greater in women, those with a higher BMI, and those with more primary care visits, sleep apnea, or a mental health condition. Likelihood of participation was lower among those who were younger than 55 (vs 55-64), widowed, current smokers, and residing farther from the medical center (≥30 vs {\textless}30 miles).

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cohort study, differences in weight change up to 10 years after surgery were estimated in retrospective cohorts of 1787 veterans who underwent RYGB from January 1, 2000, through September 30, 2011 (573 of 700 eligible [81.9\%] with 10-year follow-up), and 5305 nonsurgical matches (1274 of 1889 eligible [67.4\%] with 10-year follow-up) in mixed-effects models. Differences in weight change up to 4 years were compared among veterans undergoing RYGB (n = 1785), SG (n = 379), and AGB (n = 246).

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Weight change up to 10 years after surgery through December 31, 2014.
RESULTS The 1787 patients undergoing RYGB had a mean (SD) age of 52.1 (8.5) years and 5305 nonsurgical matches had a mean (SD) age of 52.2 (8.4) years. Patients undergoing RYGB and nonsurgical matches had a mean body mass index of 47.7 and 47.1, respectively, and were predominantly male (1306 [73.1\%] and 3911 [73.7\%], respectively). Patients undergoing RYGB lost 21\% (95\% CI, 11\%-31\%) more of their baseline weight at 10 years than nonsurgical matches. A total of 405 of 564 patients undergoing RYGB (71.8\%) had more than 20\% estimated weight loss, and 224 of 564 (39.7\%) had more than 30\% estimated weight loss at 10 years compared with 134 of 1247 (10.8\%) and 48 of 1247 (3.9\%), respectively, of nonsurgical matches. Only 19 of 564 patients undergoing RYGB (3.4\%) regained weight back to within an estimated 5\% of their baseline weight by 10 years. At 4 years, patients undergoing RYGB lost 27.5\% (95\% CI, 23.8\%-31.2\%) of their baseline weight, patients undergoing AGB lost 10.6\% (95\% CI, 0.6\%-20.6\%), and patients undergoing SG lost 17.8\% (95\% CI, 9.7\%-25.9\%). Patients undergoing RYGB lost 16.9\% (95\% CI, 6.2\%-27.6\%) more of their baseline weight than patients undergoing AGB and 9.7\% (95\% CI, 0.8\%-18.6\%) more than patients undergoing SG.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients in the Veterans Administration health care system lost substantially more weight than nonsurgical matches and sustained most of this weight loss in the long term. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass induced significantly greater weight loss among veterans than SG or AGB at 4 years. These results provide further evidence of the beneficial association between surgery and long-term weight loss that has been demonstrated in shorter-term studies of younger, predominantly female populations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity is a growing public health concern and is becoming an epidemic among veterans in the post-deployment period.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a large cohort of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, and to evaluate trajectories of change in BMI over 3 years. DESIGN: Retrospective, longitudinal cohort analysis of veterans’ health records PARTICIPANTS: A total of 496,722 veterans (59,790 female and 436,932 male veterans) whose height and weight were recorded at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system at least once after the end of their last deployment and whose first post-deployment outpatient encounter at the VA was at least 1 year prior to the end of the study period (December 31, 2011). MAIN MEASURES: BMI, mental health diagnoses. KEY RESULTS: Seventy-five percent of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans were either overweight or obese at baseline. Four trajectories were observed: “stable overweight” represented the largest class; followed by “stable obese;” “overweight/obese gaining;” and “obese losing.” During the 3-year ascertainment period, those with PTSD and depression in particular were at the greatest risk of being either obese without weight loss or overweight or obese and continuing to gain weight. Adjustment for demographics and antipsychotic medication attenuated the relationship between BMI and certain mental health diagnoses. Although BMI trajectories were similar in men and women, some gender differences were observed. For example, the risk of being in the persistently obese class in men was highest for those with PTSD, whereas for women, the risk was highest among those with depression.
CONCLUSIONS: The growing number of overweight or obese returning veterans is a concerning problem for clinicians who work with these patients. Successful intervention to reduce the prevalence of obesity will require integrated efforts from primary care and mental},

	abstract = {Methods From April 1, 2006, to December 31, 2009, 382 veterans enrolled in the MOVE! program; 377 veterans attended at least 3 group sessions and were included in this study. All veterans were encouraged to complete 8 weekly group sessions on nutrition, lifestyle changes, and behavior modification in a group setting led by a multidisciplinary team. After completing the session, veterans had the option of continuing with a support group that meets monthly. The change in weight from 1 year pre-enrollment in MOVE! to 1, 2, and 3 years postenrollment was analyzed.
Results Veterans gained 1.4 kg per year (standard error [SE] = 0.47, P = .003) before enrolling in MOVE!. One year after the enrollment participants lost on average 2.2 kg (SE = 0.42; P {\textless} .001). The pre-enrollment slope for weight change was significantly different from the postenrollment slope.
Conclusion Findings from this study support the need for a long-term weight management program such as MOVE! in primary care settings to assist overweight and obese VA patients in achieving and maintaining weight loss to reduce the risk and progression of age-related chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.},

	abstract = {Aims: In 2007, safety warnings were publicized regarding the association between thiazolidinediones (TZDs) and cardiovascular risks. This study investigated the impact of the publicized safety warnings on glycemic outcomes in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Materials and Methods: The Veterans Integrated Services Network 16 database included 13,293 DM patients using TZDs (n=13,037 rosiglitazone, n=246 pioglitazone, n=10 both) during a baseline period of 03/01/07 to 05/31/07. Three medication use patterns groups (09/ 01/07 to 11/30/07) were defined as follows: (1) continuation on TZD treatment, (2) switching to other non-TZD treatment, (3) discontinuation of TZD treatment without any antidiabetic treatment. Primary outcome (09/01/07 to 02/29/08) was change from baseline in A1c. The analysis of variance was used to test the association between use patterns and A1c change. A logistic regression model was used to identify the predictors for use patterns. Results: Patients (45.1\%, n=5999) discontinued their TZD use. Both Groups 2 and 3 had significant A1c increases (both P values b.0001). Significant predictors for TZD discontinuation included black race, baseline heart disease, and diabetic complication [odds ratio (OR), 1.43; OR, 1.54; OR, 1.30, respectively]. Of the patients remaining on TZD therapy, 11.8\% experienced improved A1c levels, and a lower percentage of patients (9.53\%) experienced a deterioration in A1c levels (Pb.0001). Patients who switched or discontinued an antidiabetic medication experienced improvements in body mass index (Pb.0001) and triglycerides (Pb.0036). The three use pattern groups had similar changes with regard to blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein. Conclusion: Thiazolidinedione safety warnings may have negatively impacted the glycemic control in DM patients.},
