Description: A collection of weight measurement algorithms designed to prepare 
    weight measurements for further analyses. Package contains 12 algorithms 
    identified in the literature review "Annis, A. et al. Construction and Use 
    of Body Weight Measures from Administrative Data in a Large National Health 
    System: A Systematic Review. Obesity Reviews. 2020". In that work we 
    identified 39 studies that constructed body weight measures from Veterans 
    Health Administration data. Seven studies did not include enough information 
    necessary to reconstruct a measurement processing algorithm, and of the 
    remaining 32, 12 algorithms were deemed unique. See the project Github
    github.com/ccmrcodes/WeightAlgorithms for example usage.
