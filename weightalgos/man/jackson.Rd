\usage{
jackson(
  df,
  id,
  measures,
  tmeasures,
  startPoint,
  t = c(0, 182, 365, 730),
  windows = c(1, 90, 90, 90),
  outliers = c(75, 700)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{object of class \code{data.frame}, containing \code{id} and
\code{measures}.}

\item{id}{string corresponding to the name of the column of patient
identifers in \code{df}.}

\item{measures}{string corresponding to the name of the column of
measurements in \code{df}.}

\item{tmeasures}{string corresponding to the name of the column of
measurement collection dates or times in \code{df}. If \code{tmeasures} is
a date object, there may be more than one weight on the same day, if it is
a precise datetime object, there may not be more than one weight on the
same day. Just something to look out for.}

\item{startPoint}{string corresponding to the name of the column in \code{df}
holding the time at which subsequent measurement dates will be assessed,
should be the same for each person. Eg., if t = 0 (\code{t[1]}) corresponds
to an index visit held by the variable \code{VisitDate}, then
\code{startPoint} should be set to \code{VisitDate}.}

\item{t}{numeric vector of time points to collect measurements, e.g.
\code{c(0, 182.5, 365)} for measure collection at t = 0, t = 180 (6 months
from t = 0), and t = 365 (1 year from t = 0). Default is
\code{c(0, 182, 365, 730)} according to Jackson et al. 2015.}

\item{windows}{numeric vector of measurement collection windows to use around
each time point in \code{t}. E.g. Jackson et al. 2015 use
\code{c(1, 90, 90, 90)} for \code{t = c(0, 182.5, 365, 730)}, implying that
the closest measurement t = 0 will be collected on the day of the
\code{startPoint}. Subsequent measurements will be collected 90 days prior
to and 90 days post t0+182.5 days, t0+365 days, and t0+730 days.}

\item{outliers}{numeric vector corresponding to the upper and lower bound for
each time entry. Default is \code{c(75, 700)}.}
}
\value{
returns a data frame reduced by the inclusion criteria defined in
  \code{t}, \code{windows} and \code{outliers}, and further reduced to 4
  columns: the value of \code{id}; the average of the measures defined in
  \code{measures} at each \code{t} and \code{windows}, denoted the
  \code{measout};the number of measures used to calculate \code{measout} at
  time \code{t}; \code{measureTime}, the time-point defined by \code{t}.
}
\description{
For grouped time series, (e.g., per person), \code{jackson} removes outliers,
then apply windows to each measurement within each block of time/window, then
averages all measurements within that window. Based on work by Jackson et al.
2015
